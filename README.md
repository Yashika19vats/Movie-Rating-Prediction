# Movie-Rating-Prediction
This project aims to predict IMDb movie ratings using machine learning techniques based on features like **genre**, **director**, **actors**, **runtime**, and other metadata.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Evaluation metrics
- Final model performance summary

- Source: [Kaggle IMDb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)

- **Features**:
  - `Title`
  - `Genre`
  - `Actor`
  - `Director`
  - `Year`
- **Target Variable**: `Rating`

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Several visualizations were created to explore relationships and patterns in the dataset:

- **Distribution of Ratings**: Histogram to see how movie ratings are spread.
- **Ratings Over the Years**: Line plot or scatter plot of rating trends by release year.
- **Top Genres by Average Rating**: Bar plot of genres and their mean ratings.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualizes relationships between numerical features (e.g., `Year`, `Rating`, encoded categories).
- **Boxplots**: Ratings by top actors/directors to detect outliers or patterns.

These plots helped guide feature selection and preprocessing.
